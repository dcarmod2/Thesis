This implies an algebraic Bott sequence and a new proof and generalisation of Karoubi's Fundamental Theorem. For the higher GrothendieckâWitt groups of vector bundles of (possibly singular) schemes X with an ample family of line-bundles such that 12âÎ(X,OX), we obtain MayerâVietoris long exact sequences for Nisnevich coverings and blow-ups along regularly embedded centres, projective bundle formulas, and a Bass fundamental theorem. For coherent GrothendieckâWitt groups, we obtain a localization theorem analogous to Quillen's Kâ²-localization theorem."

We extend to this equivariant setting the main foundational results of motivic homotopy theory: the (unstable) purity and gluing theorems of MorelâVoevodsky and the (stable) ambidexterity theorem of Ayoub. Our proof of the latter is different than Ayoub's and is of interest even when G is trivial. Using these results, we construct a formalism of six operations for equivariant motivic spectra, and we deduce that any cohomology theory for G-schemes that is represented by an absolute motivic spectrum satisfies descent for the cdh topology."

abstract="In this paper we prove a localization theorem for the K-theory of commutative rings and of schemes, Theorem 7.4, relating the K-groups of a scheme, of an open subscheme, and of the category of those perfect complexes on the scheme which are acyclic on the open subscheme. The localization theorem of Quillen [Q1] for K{\textasciiacutex}- or G-theory is the main support of his many results on the G-theory of noetherian schemes. The previous lack of an adequate localization theorem for K-theory has obstructed development of this theory for the fifteen years since 1973. Hence our theorem unleashes a pack of new basic results hitherto known only under very restrictive hypotheses like regularity. These new results include the ``Bass fundamental theorem'' 6.6, the Zariski (Nisnevich) cohomolog-ical descent spectral sequence that reduces problems to the case of local (hensel local) rings 10.3 and 19.8, the Mayer-Vietoris theorem for open covers 8.1, invariance mod â under polynomial extensions 9.5, Vorst-van der Kallen theory for NK 9.12, Goodwillie and Ogle-Weibel theorems relating K-theory to cyclic cohomology 9.10, mod â Mayer-Vietoris for closed covers 9.8, and mod â comparison between algebraic and topological K-theory 11.5 and 11.9. Indeed most known results in K-theory can be improved by the methods of this paper, by removing now unnecessary regularity, affineness, and other hypotheses.",
