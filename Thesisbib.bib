This implies an algebraic Bott sequence and a new proof and generalisation of Karoubi's Fundamental Theorem. For the higher GrothendieckâWitt groups of vector bundles of (possibly singular) schemes X with an ample family of line-bundles such that 12âÎ(X,OX), we obtain MayerâVietoris long exact sequences for Nisnevich coverings and blow-ups along regularly embedded centres, projective bundle formulas, and a Bass fundamental theorem. For coherent GrothendieckâWitt groups, we obtain a localization theorem analogous to Quillen's Kâ²-localization theorem."

We extend to this equivariant setting the main foundational results of motivic homotopy theory: the (unstable) purity and gluing theorems of MorelâVoevodsky and the (stable) ambidexterity theorem of Ayoub. Our proof of the latter is different than Ayoub's and is of interest even when G is trivial. Using these results, we construct a formalism of six operations for equivariant motivic spectra, and we deduce that any cohomology theory for G-schemes that is represented by an absolute motivic spectrum satisfies descent for the cdh topology."

In particular, Balmer Witt groups can be nicely expressed as homotopy groups of a topological space. The proof includes a motivic version of real Bott periodicity. Consequences include other new results related to projective spaces, blow ups and homotopy purity. The results became part of the proof of Morel's conjecture on certain A1-homotopy groups of spheres."
