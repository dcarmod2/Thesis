abstract = "Within the framework of dg categories with weak equivalences and duality that have uniquely 2-divisible mapping complexes, we show that higher GrothendieckâWitt groups (aka. hermitian K-groups) are invariant under derived equivalences and that Morita exact sequences induce long exact sequences of GrothendieckâWitt groups. This implies an algebraic Bott sequence and a new proof and generalisation of Karoubi's Fundamental Theorem. For the higher GrothendieckâWitt groups of vector bundles of (possibly singular) schemes X with an ample family of line-bundles such that 12âÎ(X,OX), we obtain MayerâVietoris long exact sequences for Nisnevich coverings and blow-ups along regularly embedded centres, projective bundle formulas, and a Bass fundamental theorem. For coherent GrothendieckâWitt groups, we obtain a localization theorem analogous to Quillen's Kâ²-localization theorem."
